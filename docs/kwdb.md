# TSBS Supplemental Guide: KWDB-tsbs

KWDB is a distributed multimodal database product designed for AIoT IoT scenarios. It supports the simultaneous 
establishment of temporal and relational databases on the same instance and the fusion processing of multimodal data. 
It has efficient processing capabilities for temporal sequence data, including access to millions of devices, writing of 
millions of data in seconds, and reading of billions of data in seconds. It is characterized by stability, security, 
high availability, and easy operation and maintenance.

This document is a supplement to the main README_zh, detailing the following content:

*Related usage of data generation tool (`tsbs_generate_data`).<br>
*Related usage of data import tool (`tsbs_load_kwdb`).<br>
*Related usage of query generation tool (`tsbs_generate_queries`).<br>
*Related usage of the query execution tool (`tsbs_run_queries_kwdb`).<br>

**This should be read *after* the main README_zh [(supplemental docs)](../README_zh.md).**

## Data format

Data generated by `tsbs_generate_data` for kwdb is serialized in a
"pseudo-CSV" format. Each reading consists of a row, the first item is the operation type represented by 1, 3.

- 3 means write tag values, the format is:
  - `3,table name,ptag name,attribute values`
- 1 means insert data (including data values and ptag value), the format is:
  - `1,ptag name,field count,insert data`


An example for the `cpu-only` use case:

```text
3,cpu,host_0,('host_0','eu-central-1','eu-central-1a','6','Ubuntu15.10','x86','SF','19','1','test')
1,host_0,11,(1451606400000,58,2,24,61,22,63,6,44,80,38,'host_0')
```

## `tsbs_generate_data` Additional Flags
```bash
`--use-case="cpu-only" --seed=123 --scale=100 --log-interval="10s"  --timestamp-start="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" --timestamp-end="2016-02-01T00:00:00Z"  --format="kwdb" --orderquantity=12`
```
#### `-use-case` (type: `string`, default: `cpu-only`)
cpu-only/IoT

#### `-scale` (type: `int`)
Number of devices, please note that some queries require specifying more than 10 devices to meet the query requirements

#### `-log-interval` (type: `string`)
Sampling interval time

#### `-timestamp-start` (type: `string`)
Start time of data sampling, default 2016-01-01T00:00:00Z

#### `-timestamp-end` (type: `string`)
End time of data sampling

#### `-format` (type: `string`)
type:kwdb

#### `-orderquantity` (type: `int`, default: `12`)
Number of devices generated first, for example for 100 devices, format = 12 first generate data from host_0 to host_11, then generate data from host_12 to host_23, and so on

#### `-outoforder` (type: `float`, default value: `0.0`)
Set the proportion of out of order data (value range: 0.0 to 1.0; 0 represents generating data completely in order; 0.1 represents 10% of data points out of order; 1 represents completely random out of order)
Only cpu-only scenarios are supported
#### `-outoforderwindow` (type: `time.Duration`, default value: `0`)
Control the time window range of out of order data and support multiple time unit formats (such as 60s, 1m, 1h, etc.)
(0s means not enabling out of order, generate in chronological order; 60s means allowing data to be out of order within the 60s time range
Only cpu-only scenarios are supported, the actual degree of disorder is also controlled by the outoforder parameter

## `tsbs_load_kwdb` Additional Flags

` --file=./data.dat --user=root --pass=1234 --host=127.0.0.1 --port=26257 --insert-type=insert --db-name=benchmark --case=cpu-only --batch-size=1000 --workers=12 --partition=false`
```
### connection related

#### `-insert-type` (type: `string`)
Optional as `insert, prepare, prepareiot`

Note: The correspondence between case and insert-type is as follows:

| case     | insert-type |
|----------|-------------|
